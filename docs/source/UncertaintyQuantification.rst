Uncertainty Quantification
==========================

Borehole Function
*****************

The Borehole function models water flow through a borehole. Its simplicity and quick evaluation makes it a commonly used function for testing a wide variety of methods in computer experiments.

Ishigami function
*****************

The Ishigami function of Ishigami & Homma (1990) is used as an example for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methods, because it exhibits strong nonlinearity and nonmonotonicity.
