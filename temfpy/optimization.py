def ackley(x, a=20, b=0.2, c=2 * math.pi):
    r"""Ackley function.

    This function was proposed by David Ackley in [A1987]_.
    Originally, it was formulated only for the two-dimensional case;
    it is characterized by an almost flat outer region and a central hole or peak
    where modulations become more and more influential. The function has
    its global minimum :math:`f(x) = 0` at :math:`x = (0, \dots, 0)`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    x : array_like
        Input domain with dimension d. It is usually evaluated on the hypercube
        :math:`x_i\in [-32.768, 32.768]`, for all :math:`i = 1, \dots, d`.

    float a, b, c
        Recommended variable values are 20, 0.2, 2Ï€, respectively.

    Returns
    -------

    float
         Output domain

    Notes
    -----
    A brief description of the function is available in [B1996]_ and in [M2005]_.

def rastrigin(x, a=10):
    r"""Rastrigin function.

    The function was first proposed by Rastrigin as a 2-dimensional function in [R1974]_.
    It produces frequent local minima; thus, it is highly multimodal.
    However, the location of the minima are regularly distributed.
    The function has its global minimum :math:`f(x) = 0` at :math:`x = (0, \dots, 0)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : float
        Recommended variable value is 10.

    x : array_like
        Input domain with dimension d. It is usually evaluated on the hypercube
        :math:`x_i\in [-5.12, 5.12]`, for all :math:`i = 1, \dots, d`.

    Returns

    float
         Output domain
